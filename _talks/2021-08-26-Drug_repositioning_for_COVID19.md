* Cogena-based drug repositioning is less computationally intensive than docking methods.

* The transcriptome-based drug screening that identified drugs that are capable of restoring virus-induced gene expression dysregulation, rather than directly targeting viral or human proteins, as is the case for classical molecule docking methods. Esp. dexamethasone.
* We identified two antiviral drugs (saquinavir and ribavirin) and several other candidate drugs (such as dinoprost, dipivefrine, dexamethasone and (-)-isoprenaline).
