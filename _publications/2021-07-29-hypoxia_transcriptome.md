excerpt: 'Oxygen metabolism is closely related to the intestinal homeostasis environment, and the occurrence of many intestinal diseases is as a result of the destruction of oxygen gradients. The hypobaric hypoxic environment of the plateau can cause dysfunction of the intestine for humans, such as inflammation. The compensatory response of the small intestine cells to the harsh environment definitely changes their gene expression. How the small intestine cells response the hypobaric hypoxic environment is still unclear. We studied the rat small intestine under hypobaric hypoxic conditions to explore the transcriptional changes in rats under acute/chronic hypobaric hypoxic conditions. We randomly divided rats into three groups: normal control group (S), acute hypobaric hypoxia group, exposing to hypobaric hypoxic condition for 2 weeks (W2S) and chronic hypobaric hypoxia group, exposing to hypobaric hypoxic condition for 4 weeks (W4S). The RNA sequencing was performed on the small intestine tissues of the three groups of rats. The results of principal component analysis showed that the W4S and W2S groups were quite different from the control group. We identified a total of 636 differentially expressed genes, such as ATP binding cassette, Ace2 and Fabp. KEGG pathway analysis identified several metabolic and digestive pathways, such as PPAR signaling pathway, glycerolipid metabolism, fat metabolism, mineral absorption and vitamin metabolism. Cogena analysis found that up-regulation of digestive and metabolic functions began from the second week of high altitude exposure. Our study highlights the critical role of metabolic and digestive pathways of the intestine in response to the hypobaric hypoxic environment, provides new aspects for the molecular effects of hypobaric hypoxic environment on intestine, and raises further questions about between the lipid metabolism disorders and inflammation.'

Oxygen metabolism is closely related to the intestinal homeostasis environment, and the occurrence of many intestinal diseases is as a result of the destruction of oxygen gradients. The hypobaric hypoxic environment of the plateau can cause dysfunction of the intestine for humans, such as inflammation. The compensatory response of the small intestine cells to the harsh environment definitely changes their gene expression. How the small intestine cells response the hypobaric hypoxic environment is still unclear. We studied the rat small intestine under hypobaric hypoxic conditions to explore the transcriptional changes in rats under acute/chronic hypobaric hypoxic conditions. We randomly divided rats into three groups: normal control group (S), acute hypobaric hypoxia group, exposing to hypobaric hypoxic condition for 2 weeks (W2S) and chronic hypobaric hypoxia group, exposing to hypobaric hypoxic condition for 4 weeks (W4S). The RNA sequencing was performed on the small intestine tissues of the three groups of rats.
